My app is like a game-changer in factories. It's making things work better, and I want to help factory workers do their jobs more easily and save time and money.

This change isn't just for one factory; it's like a model for how all factories can do better. It's a big deal because it's like a roadmap for the whole industry to become more efficient and connected.

And the best part? Anyone around the world can use this app to make their work better too. It's all about making things simpler and more efficient for everyone.



### HeatPump

Project Goal:
The project aims to create a heating control system using a heat pump, utilizing the Raspberry Pi platform. The system will enable temperature control and the management of the heat pump in an energy-efficient manner.

Modification to the heat pump involves changing its operation mode:
Previously, the pump operated in an ON/OFF mode, but now it will adjust its performance based on the system's demand, significantly reducing energy consumption.

The system is equipped with a dedicated touch screen. The same control interface is accessible from any device with a web browser after authorization.

Technologies and Libraries Used:

- Raspberry Pi: The platform on which our system operates.
- Flask: Utilized for creating a web interface that allows users to control the heating system.
- APScheduler: A library for task scheduling, essential for the smooth operation of the system.
- SQLite: A database for storing temperature data and heating settings.
- datetime: A library for working with date and time.

System Features:

1. Temperature Monitoring: The system will read temperatures at various points using sensors and store this data in a database.

2. Heat Pump Management: In automatic mode, the heat pump operates without human intervention, while in manual mode, users have full control over its operation.

3. Temperature Settings: Users can set the desired room or hot water temperature, establish a heating schedule, and select from various operation modes depending on the season.

4. Visualization: The system allows for displaying the collected data as charts, greatly facilitating analysis. Users can freely select the range of data to be displayed.

5. Work Schedule: The system will enable the creation of a heat pump operating schedule based on the days of the week and specific times.

6. Web Interface: Flask will be used to create a simple web interface, allowing users to easily manage the system.

7. Security: Adequate access controls will be implemented to ensure that only authorized individuals can control the heating system.

The added value of this project lies in the potential to enhance thermal comfort in spaces and achieve energy savings through intelligent heat pump management. The system will also enable the monitoring of energy consumption and temperatures at various locations, which can be valuable for analysis and optimization purposes. It's worth noting that the graphic design in this project represents a hard-earned achievement based on the UI, as well as experience from previous projectsâ€”please don't judge too harshly.

The project will be implemented using the Python programming language and the relevant libraries.

**Quality Control Station**

The project aims to create a quality control station based on a vision system. It utilizes Inspector 62x cameras and the SICK AppStudio programming environment. The system will enable the verification of the correct selection of an order by analyzing the received image and comparing it to a reference image.

The station is equipped with monitors, and system operation can be accessed through any web browser.

**Key Features:**

- **Easy to Use:** It's as easy as using a regular website. You can control it from any web browser on your computer.

- **Flexible Control:** For experts, there are lots of settings you can adjust to make it work just right for your needs.

- **Different Modes:** It can work in different ways to make it simple to take pictures of products for future reference.

- **Real-Time Feedback:** It shows you the results of its checks right away, including how long it took.

- **Works with Other Machines:** It can connect and work together with other machines in the factory.

- **Error Detection and Reject Control:** If something is wrong with a product, the system knows and can decide to reject it, making sure only the best products are approved.

- **Super Secure:** It's designed to be very secure, so no one can cheat or stop it from doing its job.

My Quality Control Station is like having a super smart inspector that never makes mistakes. It uses smart cameras and software to make sure products are top quality. It's easy to use, works with other machines, and even catches mistakes on its own. Plus, it's super secure, so you can trust it to do its job right every time.
