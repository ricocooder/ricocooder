## Examples of Work

### HeatPump

Project Goal:
The project aims to create a heating control system using a heat pump, utilizing the Raspberry Pi platform. The system will enable temperature control and the management of the heat pump in an energy-efficient manner.

Modification to the heat pump involves changing its operation mode:
Previously, the pump operated in an ON/OFF mode, but now it will adjust its performance based on the system's demand, significantly reducing energy consumption.

Technologies and Libraries Used:

- Raspberry Pi: The platform on which our system operates.
- Flask: Utilized for creating a web interface that allows users to control the heating system.
- APScheduler: A library for task scheduling, essential for the smooth operation of the system.
- SQLite: A database for storing temperature data and heating settings.
- datetime: A library for working with date and time.
- time: A library for handling time-related functions.
- os: A library for file system operations.

System Features:

1. Temperature Monitoring: The system will read temperatures at various points using sensors and store this data in a database.

2. Heat Pump Management: In automatic mode, the heat pump operates without human intervention, while in manual mode, users have full control over its operation.

3. Temperature Settings: Users can set the desired room or hot water temperature, establish a heating schedule, and select from various operation modes depending on the season.

4. Visualization: The system allows for displaying the collected data as charts, greatly facilitating analysis. Users can freely select the range of data to be displayed.

5. Work Schedule: The system will enable the creation of a heat pump operating schedule based on the days of the week and specific times.

6. Web Interface: Flask will be used to create a simple web interface, allowing users to easily manage the system.

7. Security: Adequate access controls will be implemented to ensure that only authorized individuals can control the heating system.

The added value of this project lies in the potential to enhance thermal comfort in spaces and achieve energy savings through intelligent heat pump management. The system will also enable the monitoring of energy consumption and temperatures at various locations, which can be valuable for analysis and optimization purposes. It's worth noting that the graphic design in this project represents a hard-earned achievement based on the UI, as well as experience from previous projectsâ€”please don't judge too harshly.

The project will be implemented using the Python programming language and the relevant libraries.
